.SH NAME
pfsinrgbe \- Load images or frames in Radiance RGBE format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pfsinrgbe
[--linear] (<file> [--frames <range>] [--skip-missing])  [<file>...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I pfsinrgbe
command loads images in Radiance RGBE format and writes \fIpfs\fR
stream to the Standard Output. The \fIpfs\fR stream is usually piped
to another program for further processing. To detect the format
automatically based on the extension, use \fIpfsin\fR command.
.PP
Since RGBE is an HDR format, 'LUMINANCE' tag is set to 'RELATIVE'
(relative linear luminance values).
.PP
To read images from standard input use a single dash '-' instead of
filename. The images are read until EOF is reached.
.PP
Each file can contain a \%%d pattern, which is substituted with frame
numbers. The pattern has the same syntax as C
.I printf
command. For example, you can use \%%04d to make the frame number
four digit with proceedings zeros. You can select the frames using the
following options (the options must be always given after the file
name):
.TP
.B \--frames <range>
Range is given in mathlab / octave format:

.B "startframe:step:endframe"

Frame numbers start with
.B "startframe"
(default 0), are increased by
.B "step"
(default 1) and stop at
.B "endframe"
You can skip one of those values, for example
.I "1:100"
for frames 1,2,...,100 and
.I 0:2:
for frame 0,2,4,... up to the last file that exists.

.TP
.B \--skip-missing
Skip up to ten frames in a row if corresponding files are
missing. Otherwise the program stops reading sequence at the first
file that does not exists. This switch does not apply to the first
frame in a sequence. This switch can be useful if there is a rendered
animation where some of the frame has not been generated.

.TP
.B \--linear
Ignored for compatibility with \fIpfsinppm\fR.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
pfsinrgbe intro\%%d.hdr frame\%%d.hdr | ...

Concatenate two animations into one and pass it to pipe for further
processing.

.SH IMPORTANT NOTE

There is an incompatibility between viewers of RGBE format in terms of
absolute luminance values. The ximage viewer from Radiance package
expects radiance values in RGBE files and uses the WHITE_EFFICACY
constant equal to 179.0f to convert from radiance to luminance. This
in practice means that the values displayed with pfsview maybe higher
than expected. To compensate for this incompatibility we suggest to
use \fIpfsabsolute\fR command:

pfsinrgbe measured_luminance.hdr | pfsabsolute 1 179 | pfsview

This is not necessary when RGBE files are saved using
\fIpfsoutrgbe\fR, Radiance package, mkhdr or Photospheare. This is
also not relevant when only relative absolute values are considered.
